# RAG-Based-AI
This RAG based AI assistant will fetch the text out of video files from a course. My system is domain-specific and grounded in the course material. It retrieves semantically relevant transcript segments and generates responses only from that context. It also provides timestamp references, improving explainability and user trust.
